Description: The package helps with the assessment and correction of
        RNA degradation effects in Affymetrix 3' expression arrays. The
        parameter d gives a robust and accurate measure of RNA
        integrity. The correction removes the probe positional bias,
        and thus improves comparability of samples that are affected by
        RNA degradation.
